# DengL â€“ Breaking down language barriers

![](presentation/gif-2.gif)

## Challenge

The challenge is set by the company Knowron during the TUM.ai Makeathon 2023.

Make integration into the job market easier for immigrant workers by allowing them to document their work without speaking the native
language of the country.

The idea is to create more opportunities and break down the language barrier in the job market.

Create an efficient and effective process for report creation that incorporates notes and voice memos using NLP to enable talents worldwide to collaborate.

No hallucinations should be present.

## Usage

The service that was developed during the Makeathon can be used for free at a privately hosted [Website](https://whai.yousuckatprogramming.de/#/intro).

## Installation

Next to cloning this repository it is also necessary to install one of the latest releases of [_wkhtmltopdf_](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases) for automatic pdf generation.
