		"The purpose of this intervention is to adjust the bearings and twist torque on both levele of the HQM"
	],
	solution: [
		`Today I worked on several tasks related to the production and maintenance of the IBC. I helped with fixing the IBC motor\
		failure, which was caused by the web not being pulled up properly. I fixed this by changing the IBC correction value from\
		15 to 20. Then I released the torque on HQ1 and reseated the upper and lower blades. I also adjusted the HQ1 bearings\
		and the twist torque to optimize the cutting of dry 42# liner.`,
		`I secured the twisting flange fixing bolts with 650Nm of torque. I repeated the same process for HQ2, but also tuned it\
		with wet 42# liner. I tuned HQ1 with wet 42# liner as well.\
		I checked the zero pulse on both levels and found no issues. I ran HQM in test mode with a 840mm cut off at 1000fpm\
		for an hour and it worked fine. The BHS electrician replaced the drive for HQ1 because it was faulty at higher speeds. I\
		checked the bearing temperatures and they were all within spec. I checked the brake function of the medium and top\
		liner roll stand with Scott.`,
		`I also helped change out some bad clean out fingers on C flute. At 10pm, I came back to\
		monitor the production and check the cut quality and everything was running smoothly.`
